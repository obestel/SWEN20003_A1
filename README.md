SWEN20003 Project 1

I have spent a lot of time (alot!!!) trying to get my gitlab working but I cannot seem to get the SSH key to work properly so I have manually uploaded all files instead.
This is why the layout may seem weird.
If you want to see the hsitory of my commits please refer to the files in this directory. Other than that you should be able to download the files in the structure that you want.

To run the files, simply download the repo, open it in IntelliJ IDE, double click the pom.xml file, then everything should work.
